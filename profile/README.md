## Segway ðŸ‘‹

Segway is a serious, secure, sensible, solution event gateway. What does that mean? Glad you asked

* Serious we know event data (logs) is serious business we take care to handle meaning recieve, process, and deliver that data
* Secure is a focus while confidential data is logs is a bad thing its going to happen do our part to ensure safe handling.
* Sensible nothing is perfect we won't let perfect be the enemey of good enough today but we also won't rest on good enough.
* Solution we are different because we are not a box of parts we create everything with outcomes in mind. So we focus on end to end solutions for the most important and a framework to build on with the community.
